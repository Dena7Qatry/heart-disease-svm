# Heart Disease Classification using SVM

This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify patients into two categories based on clinical features:
- `0`: No heart disease
- `1`: Presence of heart disease

## Project Overview

This notebook was developed as part of the **Intro to AI** course at BSBI. It walks through data cleaning, model building, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and evaluation on a held-out test set.

## Key Findings

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - No missing values were found.
  - Outliers were clipped using winsorization (5thâ€“95th percentile).
  
- **Model Optimization:**
  - Best SVM parameters from GridSearchCV:
    ```
    {'C': 1, 'gamma': 0.01, 'kernel': 'sigmoid'}
    ```
  - Cross-validation accuracy: **0.8345**

- **Final Model Evaluation on Test Set:**
  - Accuracy: **0.8524**
  - Precision: **0.96**
  - Recall: **0.75**
  - F1 Score: **0.8421**
  - AUC-ROC: **0.8577**

## Next Steps

- Further hyperparameter tuning
- Try other algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Feature engineering & PCA
